LangHelper uses the Gemini API to assit with language learning! I have been using doulingo for the past few months to learn Norwegian (Hyggelig å møte deg) however I felt 
like the app was lacking in long form content as well as other custimizablity features.

The main purpose of this application is to create sample paragraphs and sentantces in various languages. It allows you
to add words into your dictionary so you can put words in as you learn them and then create parahraphs with them. It also has translation and chat features.

 Note: In order to use gemini you need an API key which I can provide if you'd like to try it our yourself or you can look in the screenshots folder for some examples.
